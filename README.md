# Predicting-Features-for-an-Android-App-NLP-
This NLP project was part of a Special Problem under Dr. Charles Isbell at gatech

This NLP project's aim is to predict an android app's features of a future version by analyzing its user reviews. 
This would help developers learn about the features that they need to improve on first.  

Selenium tool was used to scrape the data from various websites for information such as the version number, 
version details in addition to the user reviews for each version.

The goal of the project was achieved by using clustering ,topic modelling(TF IDF) and ranking algorithms 
which ultimately predicted the features for the app.
