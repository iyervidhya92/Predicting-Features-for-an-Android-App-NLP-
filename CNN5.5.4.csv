335,2,"When it works it is very intuitive by Gwen74
The app is very intuitive for the most part and used to work very well. Alas, when I save an article I have no way to find it again. It does not appear in my saved articles online or anywhere else where I can find it. In addition, lately when I select an article to read it just opens a blank page. No idea why, this doesn't happen on my iPad 3.",9-May-14,5.5.4

631,1,"Excellent interface but astoundingly buggy by Winny joe
I've used this app almost from its first release, on an iPad 1. I think the look and feel is excellent but the software is so buggy as to be almost useless. It literally crashes at least once and usually twice in EACH section as I read the Journal on iOS 5.1. It's incredibly annoying and it comes across as if the Journal developers have never tested their software.",17-Apr-14,5.5.4

Got the latest update and then called because I couldn't bring the paper up. Totally unreasonable that a great organization can't get their sxxt in order.",8-Apr-14,5.5.4
1066,2,"Usability issue by Mr. R_
Content is wonderful. However, the app still has these issues:1. Freezes if it does not have a good connection.2. Will not display articles even after they are downloaded if connection is weak.3. It decides to download while you are reading an article then it resets to the home page.4. Navigation button does nothing about 20% of the time. Have to restart my phone to get to front page.",29-Mar-14,5.5.4

Using iPhone latest iOS, app freezes every 2nd opening. Have to force quit it then restart it to get it working again. Very annoying, should be fixed!",26-Mar-14,5.5.4

1556,3,"Mixed Review by rhill2
This app is like a rotten mackerel by moonlight; it shines and stinks. When it works properly it is a delight. It is easy to navigate between sections and between the main pages and the whole text of the bannered articles. The only criticism that I have is that often there is only one or two lines of text under the headline on the banner page, not enough to determine if you want to bring up the entire article. The major problem with the app is that it often does not load some of the pages. I am running the current version of iOS (7.0.6) but almost every time I use the app there are pages that either take a long time to load or never load. Sometime the next update in the 'Now' edition fixes that. Of course, sometimes the update hangs and the entire paper refuses to load. At that point you have to reboot your device and try again. That rapidly loses it's charm.",24-Feb-14,5.5.4

In ios7, the wsj app constantly crashes and then freezes my iPad for upwards of 5 min. Great paper and I've been a reader for 25 years but the app performance is really disappointing and a huge issue.",21-Feb-14,5.5.4
1588,4,"Not freezing any more by Longtime WSJ subscriber
It appears that they finally fixed the problem that caused the app to freeze frequently. A big improvement!",20-Feb-14,5.5.4
1589,1,"Crashmaster by Khyerbanogg
Classic for this app, version 5.5.5 was supposed to fix crash on launch. Instead, it gave me that exact behavior. Still frequent lockups, too frequent checks for news that slow down reading or advancing pages. They don't seem to understand that there is value in reading well written stories that are the result of good journalism instead of the latest headline or hurried half understood breaking story.",20-Feb-14,5.5.4
1590,1,"Pathetic by Devilndisguise
It charges you for news and keeps on sending irritating update messages.Can't uninstall and have to manually disable in so many settings. Stay away.",20-Feb-14,5.5.4

Despite the promise that the update will fix crashes, the APP still crashes regularly. It remains the worst app on my iPad. Truly a shame.",19-Feb-14,5.5.4

1612,1,"Terrible by m56335
Recent updates are atrocious. Could drive and pick up a paper faster than it takes to download. Seriously, this has become by far the worst performing app on my ipad.",19-Feb-14,5.5.4
1617,1,"Lots of bugs by Bhwareagle
I've subscribed to WSJ for years and the new update is horrible. For $23 dollars a month you would think the app would work. I've had to uninstall then install the app three times in the past week.",18-Feb-14,5.5.4
1618,1,"Content download issues by Polynome
Download of the content works slow and inconsistent. Download should not stop when iPad goes into the sleep mode. Today I spent over 10 min downloading two issues, i have to keep iPad on, the update indicator shows download complete but when i try to open it without Internet connection the whole app closes. Often some of the sections get downloaded but the other don't and there is no indication until you try to open an article. Then the whole app closes. The users should have an option to move the app in or out of newsstand.After I downloaded the latest update to iPad the latest issues don't download at all. Download is stuck on the weekend edition.",18-Feb-14,5.5.4
1619,1,"Used to be good by LovedMy][+
Recent app updates have resulted in stuck content (stories remain on pages for weeks or months - and new content from the same blog on the website is never added to the app), duplicate content entries (the same stories shows up in multiple pages in the app), flooding of the US news section with NY specific stories (which used to be in a separate NY section so we could ignore them), and frequent failures to load pages. They need to revert back to the version from last fall - it was much more stable.",18-Feb-14,5.5.4
1620,1,"Fantastic Publication - Horrible App! by BP407
The WSJ is wonderful. This app however is NOT. I used to love it, now each update is worse than the prior. Prior days issues no longer load on the screen with the most recent update. If it weren't for the phenomenal writing content I'd drop this app in a heartbeat. Please quit tarnishing your reputation and put out a quality product that's more fitting for a world class publication.",18-Feb-14,5.5.4

1623,1,"It gets worse by Anacapaman
Now I have to log in every time I launch the app. And I repeatedly have to delete app and reload in order to reduce its memory hogging. This is by far the worst memory hog on my iPad.",18-Feb-14,5.5.4
1625,2,"Latest Update (Feb 2014) by JCP433
This update mostly eliminated the screen freezes for me. However, now it just quits after accessing stories. I seldom ever finish perusing the WSJ before the app just quits. Sometimes I re-enter to finish the edition, sometimes I just give up.NOTE TO WSJ AND DEVELOPERS: We pay a lot for this subscription. At some point, we hope to get what we pay for.UPDATE Feb 18, 2014: Just downloaded ""latest fix"" from yesterday's updates. Was really excited to see it acting mostly like it should... Until the last section (local NY news). Half way through, the program quit. (Sigh). Great beta testing, folks.",18-Feb-14,5.5.4
